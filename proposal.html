        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p> 
            The topic of interest is sneaker reselling. Sneaker reselling is the idea of purchasing limited shoes such as newly released Jordan’s and selling them at a higher price which has been coined the term ‘flipping’. Sneaker resellers make many transactions which causes <em>the problem of losing track of what sneakers they’ve purchased and sold</em> if they aren’t using something to manage their sales. Not managing sneaker transactions can negatively impact resellers because they will lose valuable information such as details about sneakers they’ve bought and sold and how much profit/losses they’ve made.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Sneaker sales management is a problem that needs to be addressed because <em>current and previous attempts at solving this problem are insufficient in tracking and sorting one’s sneaker sales</em>. For example, popular sites like 
            <!-- Reference to StockX portfolio feature-->
            <a href="https://stockx.com/portfolios">StockX's</a>
            portfolio feature allows the user to manage sneakers but only shows how much the shoes currently sell for rather than how much users sold them for. Another web app that is aimed at managing sneaker sales, 
            <!-- Reference to article explaining SneakerBills-->
            <a href="https://medium.com/@daniel.revie1/managing-sneaker-inventory-7d8b8699d908">SneakerBills</a>
            , includes information on sale history. However, this application lacks the ability of sorting sneakers by size, color, and even product name.

        <h2 class="pad">App Description</h2>
        <p> 
            The users of the sneaker sales management application are sneaker resellers. The app is intended to help manage sneaker sales for both novice resellers with few amounts of sales and experienced resellers with a lot of sales. The application is intended for data collection so users will be viewing their own information. 
        </p>
        <h3> Functionality</h3>
        <p>Users will be able to add and sort through their sneaker sales. Interactions that will be provided include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Inputting sneaker sale information</li>
            <li>Searching for a specific sneaker </li>
            <li>Editing details about sneakers</li>
            <li>Sorting through sneaker sales ex) size, color</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This application is a solution to managing sneaker sales because it allows users to input information about sales history. Unlike other existing sneaker sales management applications, users will now be able to sort through sales in more detail. Overall, the application will make managing and sorting sneaker sales easier for resellers.
